# Fake-News-Detector

Used Sklearn to create a fake news detector. With this information, I made a confusion matrix to better display the fake vs real news, which you can see on the Juypter notebook. This take news detector got over 93% which is what I would say better than the human species ourselves! By Henry Boisdequin (1 month and 2 weeks into programming)
